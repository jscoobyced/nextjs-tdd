# Getting Started with NextJS and TDD

Test Driven Development (TDD) is a software development approach where tests are written before the implementation of the code. It follows a cycle of "Red-Green-Refactor" to guide the development process.

This template project aims at:
- providing a starting point to create a NextJS application with support for
  - Unit Test, using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/), a delightful JavaScript Testing Framework with a focus on simplicity. This project enables a watch-mode by default, so the added or modified tests are automatically run.
  - E2E Test using [Cypress](https://cypress.io). With Cypress, you can easily create tests for your modern web applications, debug them visually, and automatically run them in your continuous integration builds.
- containerized environment, so all you need is the `docker` and `docker-compose` commands configured on your machine
